       "['In theoretical computer science and mathematics, the theory of computation is the branch that deals with what problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm, how efficiently they can be solved or to what degree (e.g., approximate solutions versus precise ones).  The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and formal languages, computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question: \"What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?\".\\nIn order to perform a rigorous study of computation, computer scientists work with a mathematical abstraction of computers called a model of computation. There are several models in use, but the most commonly examined is the Turing machine. Computer scientists study the Turing machine because it is simple to formulate, can be analyzed and used to prove results, and because it represents what many consider the most powerful possible \"reasonable\" model of computation (see Church–Turing thesis). It might seem that the potentially infinite memory capacity is an unrealizable attribute, but any decidable problem solved by a Turing machine will always require only a finite amount of memory. So in principle, any problem that can be solved (decided) by a Turing machine can be solved by a computer that has a finite amount of memory.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe theory of computation can be considered the creation of models of all kinds in the field of computer science. Therefore, mathematics and logic are used. In the last century, it separated from mathematics and became an independent academic discipline with its own conferences such as FOCS in 1960 and STOC in 1969, and its own awards such as the IMU Abacus Medal (established in 1981 as the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize), the Gödel Prize, established in 1993, and the Knuth Prize, established in 1996.\\nSome pioneers of the theory of computation were Ramon Llull, Alonzo Church, Kurt Gödel, Alan Turing, Stephen Kleene, Rózsa Péter, John von Neumann and Claude Shannon.\\n\\n\\n== Branches ==\\n\\n\\n=== Automata theory ===\\n\\nAutomata theory is the study of abstract machines (or more appropriately, abstract \\'mathematical\\' machines or systems) and the computational problems that can be solved using these machines. These abstract machines are called automata. Automata comes from the Greek word (Αυτόματα) which means that something is doing something by itself.\\nAutomata theory is also closely related to formal language theory, as the automata are often classified by the class of formal languages they are able to recognize. An automaton can be a finite representation of a formal language that may be an infinite set. Automata are used as theoretical models for computing machines, and are used for proofs about computability.\\n\\n\\n==== Formal Language theory ====\\n\\nLanguage theory is a branch of mathematics concerned with describing languages as a set of operations over an alphabet. It is closely linked with automata theory, as automata are used to generate and recognize formal languages. There are several classes of formal languages, each allowing more complex language specification than the one before it, i.e. Chomsky hierarchy, and each corresponding to a class of automata which recognizes it. Because automata are used as models for computation, formal languages are the preferred mode of specification for any problem that must be computed.\\n\\n\\n=== Computability theory ===\\n\\nComputability theory deals primarily with the question of the extent to which a problem is solvable on a computer. The statement that the halting problem cannot be solved by a Turing machine is one of the most important results in computability theory, as it is an example of a concrete problem that is both easy to formulate and impossible to solve using a Turing machine.  Much of computability theory builds on the halting problem result.\\nAnother important step in computability theory was Rice\\'s theorem, which states that for all non-tr',\n",
       " 'In theoretical computer science and mathematics, computational complexity theory focuses on classifying computational problems according to their resource usage, and explores the relationships between these classifications. A computational problem is a task solved by a computer. A computation problem is solvable by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.\\nA problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used. The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying their computational complexity, i.e., the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. Other measures of complexity are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in communication complexity), the number of gates in a circuit (used in circuit complexity) and the number of processors (used in parallel computing). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do. The P versus NP problem, one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, is part of the field of computational complexity.\\nClosely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory. A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem. More precisely, computational complexity theory tries to classify problems that can or cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources. In turn, imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory: the latter theory asks what kinds of problems can, in principle, be solved algorithmically.\\n\\n\\n== Computational problems ==\\n\\n\\n=== Problem instances ===\\nA computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of instances together with a set (possibly empty) of solutions for every instance. The input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance, and should not be confused with the problem itself. In computational complexity theory, a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved. In contrast, an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance, which can serve as the input for a decision problem. For example, consider the problem of primality testing. The instance is a number (e.g., 15) and the solution is \"yes\" if the number is prime and \"no\" otherwise (in this case, 15 is not prime and the answer is \"no\"). Stated another way, the instance is a particular input to the problem, and the solution is the output corresponding to the given input.\\nTo further highlight the difference between a problem and an instance, consider the following instance of the decision version of the travelling salesman problem: Is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of Germany\\'s 15 largest cities? The quantitative answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem, such as asking for a round trip through all sites in Milan whose total length is at most 10 km. For this reason, complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances.\\n\\n\\n=== Representing problem instances ===\\nWhen considering computational problems, a problem instance is a string over an alphabet. Usually, the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet (i.e., the set {0,1}), and thus the strings are bitstrings. As in a real-world computer, mathematical objects other than bitstrings must be suitably encoded. For example, integers can be represented in binary notation, and graphs can be encoded directly via their adjacency matrices, o',\n",
       " 'In philosophy of mind, the computational theory of mind (CTM), also known as computationalism, is a family of views that hold that the human mind is an information processing system and that cognition and consciousness together are a form of computation. It is closely related to functionalism, a broader theory that defines mental states by what they do rather than what they\\'re made of.\\nWarren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943) were the first to suggest that neural activity is computational. They argued that neural computations explain cognition. The theory was proposed in its modern form by Hilary Putnam in 1967, and developed by his PhD student, philosopher, and cognitive scientist Jerry Fodor in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. It was later criticized in the 1990s by Putnam himself, John Searle, and others.\\nThe computational theory of mind holds that the mind is a computational system that is realized (i.e. physically implemented) by neural activity in the brain. The theory can be elaborated in many ways and varies largely based on how the term computation is understood. Computation is commonly understood in terms of Turing machines which manipulate symbols according to a rule, in combination with the internal state of the machine. The critical aspect of such a computational model is that we can abstract away from particular physical details of the machine that is implementing the computation. For example, the appropriate computation could be implemented either by silicon chips or biological neural networks, so long as there is a series of outputs based on manipulations of inputs and internal states, performed according to a rule. CTM therefore holds that the mind is not simply analogous to a computer program, but that it is literally a computational system.\\nComputational theories of mind are often said to require mental representation because \\'input\\' into a computation comes in the form of symbols or representations of other objects. A computer cannot compute an actual object but must interpret and represent the object in some form and then compute the representation. The computational theory of mind is related to the representational theory of mind in that they both require that mental states are representations. However, the representational theory of mind shifts the focus to the symbols being manipulated. This approach better accounts for systematicity and productivity. In Fodor\\'s original views, the computational theory of mind is also related to the language of thought. The language of thought theory allows the mind to process more complex representations with the help of semantics.\\nRecent work has suggested that we make a distinction between the mind and cognition. Building from the tradition of McCulloch and Pitts, the computational theory of cognition (CTC) states that neural computations explain cognition. The computational theory of mind asserts that not only cognition, but also phenomenal consciousness or qualia, are computational. That is to say, CTM entails CTC. While phenomenal consciousness could fulfill some other functional role, computational theory of cognition leaves open the possibility that some aspects of the mind could be non-computational. CTC, therefore, provides an important explanatory framework for understanding neural networks, while avoiding counter-arguments that center around phenomenal consciousness.\\n\\n\\n== \"Computer metaphor\" ==\\nComputational theory of mind is not the same as the computer metaphor, comparing the mind to a modern-day digital computer. Computational theory just uses some of the same principles as those found in digital computing. While the computer metaphor draws an analogy between the mind as software and the brain as hardware, CTM is the claim that the mind is a computational system. More specifically, it states that a computational simulation of a mind is sufficient for the actual presence of a mind, and that a mind truly can be simulated computationally.\\n\\'Computational system\\' ',\n",

A candidate definition was proposed independently by several mathematicians in the 1930s. The best-known variant was formalised by the mathematician Alan Turing, who defined a well-defined statement or calculation as any statement that could be expressed in terms of the initialisation parameters of a Turing machine. Other (mathematically equivalent) definitions include Alonzo Church\\'s lambda-definability, Herbrand-Gödel-Kleene\\'s general recursiveness and Emil Post\\'s 1-definability.\\nToday, any formal statement or calculation that exhibits this quality of well-definedness is termed computable, while the statement or calculation itself is referred to as a computation.\\nTuring\\'s definition apportioned \"well-definedness\" to a very large class of mathematical statements, including all well-formed algebraic statements, and all statements written in modern computer programming languages.\\nDespite the widespread uptake of this definition, there are some mathematical concepts that have no well-defined characterisation under this definition. This includes the halting problem and the busy beaver game. It remains an open question as to whether there exists a more powerful definition of \\'well-defined\\' that is able to capture both computable and \\'non-computable\\' statements.\\nSome examples of mathematical statements that are computable include:\\n\\nAll statements characterised in modern programming languages, including C++, Python, and Java.\\nAll calculations carried by an electronic computer, calculator or abacus.\\nAll calculations carried out on an analytical engine.\\nAll calculations carried out on a Turing Machine.\\nThe majority of mathematical statements and calculations given in maths textbooks.\\nSome examples of mathematical statements that are not computable include:\\n\\nCalculations or statements which are ill-defined, such that they cannot be unambiguously encoded into a Turing machine: (\"Paul loves me twice as much as Joe\").\\nProblem statements which do appear to be well-defined, but for which it can be proved that no Turing machine exists to solve them (such as the halting problem).\\n\\n\\n=== The Physical process of computation ===\\nComputation can be seen as a purely physical process occurring inside a closed physical system called a computer. Turing\\'s 1937 proof, On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem, demonstrated that there is a formal equivalence between computable statements and particular physical systems, commonly called computers. Examples of such physical systems are: Turing machines, human mathematicians following strict rules, digital computers, mechanical computers, analog computers and others.\\n\\n\\n== Alternative accounts of computation ==\\n\\n\\n=== The mapping account ===\\nAn alternative account of computation is found throughout the works of Hilary Putnam and others. Peter Godfrey-Smith has dubbed this the \"simple mapping account.\" Gualtiero Piccinini\\'s summary of this account states that a physical system can be said to perform a specific computation when there is a mapping between the state of that system and the computation such that the \"microphysical states [of the system] mirror the state transitions between the computational states.\"\\n\\n\\n=== The semantic account ===\\nPhilosophers such as Jerry Fodor have suggested various accounts of computation with the restriction that semantic content be a necessary condition for computation (',\n",
       " 'Computer science is the study of computation, information, and automation. Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software). \\nAlgorithms and data structures are central to computer science.\\nThe theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them. The fields of cryptography and computer security involve studying the means for secure communication and preventing security vulnerabilities. Computer graphics and computational geometry address the generation of images. Programming language theory considers different ways to describe computational processes, and database theory concerns the management of repositories of data. Human–computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software. Areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems. Computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment. Artificial intelligence and machine learning aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals. Within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process image and video data, while natural language processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.\\nThe fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated.

Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity, aiding in computations such as multiplication and division. Algorithms for performing computations have existed since antiquity, even before the development of sophisticated computing equipment.\\nWilhelm Schickard designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator in 1623. In 1673, Gottfried Leibniz demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator, called the Stepped Reckoner. Leibniz may be considered the first computer scientist and information theorist, because of various reasons, including the fact that he documented the binary number system. In 1820, Thomas de Colmar launched the mechanical calculator industry when he invented his simplified arithmometer, the first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. Charles Babbage started the design of the first automatic mechanical calculator, his Difference Engine, in 1822, which eventually gave him the idea of the first programmable mechanical calculator, his Analytical Engine. He started developing this machine in 1834, and \"in less than two years, he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer\". \"A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the Jacquard loom\" making it infinitely programmable. In 1843, during the translation of a French article on the Analytical Engine, Ada Lovelace wrote, in one of the many notes she included, an algorithm to compute the Bernoulli numbers, which is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer. Around 1885, Herman Hollerith invented the tabulator, which used punched cards to process statistical information; eventually his company became part of IBM. Following Babbage, although unaware of his earlier work, Percy Ludgate in 1909 published the 2nd of the only two designs for mechanical analytical engines in history. In 1914',\n",
       " 'In computer science, and more specifically in computability theory and computational complexity theory, a model of computation is a model which describes how an output of a mathematical function is computed given an input.

In supervised learning, an algorithm is given samples that are labeled in some useful way.  For example, the samples might be descriptions of mushrooms, and the labels could be whether or not the mushrooms are edible.  The algorithm takes these previously labeled samples and uses them to induce a classifier.  This classifier is a function that assigns labels to samples, including samples that have not been seen previously by the algorithm.  The goal of the supervised learning algorithm is to optimize some measure of performance such as minimizing the number of mistakes made on new samples.\\nIn addition to performance bounds, computational learning theory studies the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In\\ncomputational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. There are two kinds of time\\ncomplexity results:\\n\\nPositive results – Showing that a certain class of functions is learnable in polynomial time.\\nNegative results – Showing that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.\\nNegative results often rely on commonly believed, but yet unproven assumptions, such as:\\n\\nComputational complexity – P ≠ NP (the P versus NP problem);\\nCryptographic – One-way functions exist.\\nThere are several different approaches to computational learning theory based on making different assumptions about the inference principles used to generalise from limited data.

In the same decade, Donald Hebb introduced a mathematical model of learning in the brain. With mounting biological data supporting this hypothesis with some modification, the fields of neural networks and parallel distributed processing were established. In 1971, Stephen Cook and, working independently, Leonid Levin, proved that there exist practically relevant problems that are NP-complete – a landmark result in computational complexity theory.\\nModern theoretical computer science research is based on these basic developments, but includes many other mathematical and interdisciplinary problems that have been posed, as shown below:\\n\\n\\n== Topics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Algorithms ===\\n\\nAn algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for calculations.

       " 'Automata theory is the study of abstract machines and automata, as well as the computational problems that can be solved using them. It is a theory in theoretical computer science with close connections to mathematical logic. The word automata comes from the Greek word αὐτόματος, which means \"self-acting, self-willed, self-moving\". An automaton (automata in plural) is an abstract self-propelled computing device which follows a predetermined sequence of operations automatically. An automaton with a finite number of states is called a finite automaton (FA) or finite-state machine (FSM). The figure on the right illustrates a finite-state machine, which is a well-known type of automaton.  This automaton consists of states (represented in the figure by circles) and transitions (represented by arrows).  As the automaton sees a symbol of input, it makes a transition (or jump) to another state, according to its transition function, which takes the previous state and current input symbol as its arguments.\\nAutomata theory is closely related to formal language theory. In this context, automata are used as finite representations of formal languages that may be infinite. Automata are often classified by the class of formal languages they can recognize, as in the Chomsky hierarchy, which describes a nesting relationship between major classes of automata. Automata play a major role in the theory of computation, compiler construction, artificial intelligence, parsing and formal verification.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe theory of abstract automata was developed in the mid-20th century in connection with finite automata. Automata theory was initially considered a branch of mathematical systems theory, studying the behavior of discrete-parameter systems. Early work in automata theory differed from previous work on systems by using abstract algebra to describe information systems rather than differential calculus to describe material systems. The theory of the finite-state transducer was developed under different names by different research communities. The earlier concept of Turing machine was also included in the discipline along with new forms of infinite-state automata, such as pushdown automata.\\n1956 saw the publication of Automata Studies, which collected work by scientists including Claude Shannon, W. Ross Ashby, John von Neumann, Marvin Minsky, Edward F. Moore, and Stephen Cole Kleene. With the publication of this volume, \"automata theory emerged as a relatively autonomous discipline\". The book included Kleene\\'s description of the set of regular events, or regular languages, and a relatively stable measure of complexity in Turing machine programs by Shannon. \\nIn the same year, Noam Chomsky described the Chomsky hierarchy, a correspondence between automata and formal grammars, and Ross Ashby published An Introduction to Cybernetics, an accessible textbook explaining automata and information using basic set theory.\\nThe study of linear bounded automata led to the Myhill–Nerode theorem, which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a formal language to be regular, and an exact count of the number of states in a minimal machine for the language. The pumping lemma for regular languages, also useful in regularity proofs, was proven in this period by Michael O. Rabin and Dana Scott, along with the computational equivalence of deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata. \\nIn the 1960s, a body of algebraic results known as \"structure theory\" or \"algebraic decomposition theory\" emerged, which dealt with the realization of sequential machines from smaller machines by interconnection. While any finite automaton can be simulated using a  universal gate set, this requires that the simulating circuit contain loops of arbitrary complexity. Structure theory deals with the \"loop-free\" realizability of machines.\\nThe theory of computational complexity also took shape in the 1960s. By the end of the decade, automata theory came to be seen as \"the pure ma',\n",

Starting with the second edition, the book features extended coverage of examples where automata theory is applied, whereas large parts of more advanced theory were taken out.

       " 'In computability theory, a system of data-manipulation rules (such as a model of computation, a computer\\'s instruction set, a programming language, or a cellular automaton) is said to be Turing-complete or computationally universal if it can be used to simulate any Turing machine (devised by English mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing). This means that this system is able to recognize or decode other data-manipulation rule sets. Turing completeness is used as a way to express the power of such a data-manipulation rule set. Virtually all programming languages today are Turing-complete.\\nA related concept is that of Turing equivalence –  two computers P and Q are called equivalent if P can simulate Q and Q can simulate P. The Church–Turing thesis conjectures that any function whose values can be computed by an algorithm can be computed by a Turing machine, and therefore that if any real-world computer can simulate a Turing machine, it is Turing equivalent to a Turing machine. A universal Turing machine can be used to simulate any Turing machine and by extension the purely computational aspects of any possible real-world computer.\\nTo show that something is Turing-complete, it is enough to demonstrate that it can be used to simulate some Turing-complete system. No physical system can have infinite memory, but if the limitation of finite memory is ignored, most programming languages are otherwise Turing-complete.\\n\\n\\n== Non-mathematical usage ==\\nIn colloquial usage, the terms \"Turing-complete\" and \"Turing-equivalent\" are used to mean that any real-world general-purpose computer or computer language can approximately simulate the computational aspects of any other real-world general-purpose computer or computer language. In real life, this leads to the practical concepts of computing virtualization and emulation.\\nReal computers constructed so far can be functionally analyzed like a single-tape Turing machine (which uses a \"tape\" for memory); thus the associated mathematics can apply by abstracting their operation far enough. However, real computers have limited physical resources, so they are only linear bounded automaton complete.  In contrast, the abstraction of a universal computer is defined as a device with a Turing-complete instruction set, infinite memory, and infinite available time.\\n\\n\\n== Formal definitions ==\\nIn computability theory, several closely related terms are used to describe the computational power of a computational system (such as an abstract machine or programming language):\\n\\nTuring completeness\\nA computational system that can compute every Turing-computable function is called Turing-complete (or Turing-powerful). Alternatively, such a system is one that can simulate a universal Turing machine.\\nTuring equivalence\\nA Turing-complete system is called Turing-equivalent if every function it can compute is also Turing-computable; i.e., it computes precisely the same class of functions as do Turing machines. Alternatively, a Turing-equivalent system is one that can simulate, and be simulated by, a universal Turing machine. (All known physically-implementable Turing-complete systems are Turing-equivalent, which adds support to the Church–Turing thesis.)\\n(Computational) universality\\nA system is called universal with respect to a class of systems if it can compute every function computable by systems in that class (or can simulate each of those systems). Typically, the term \\'universality\\' is tacitly used with respect to a Turing-complete class of systems. The term \"weakly universal\" is sometimes used to distinguish a system (e.g. a cellular automaton) whose universality is achieved only by modifying the standard definition of Turing machine so as to include input streams with infinitely many 1s.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nTuring completeness is significant in that every real-world design for a computing device can be simulated by a universal Turing machine. The Church–Turing thesis states that this is a law of mathematics ',\n",
       " 'In computer science, the computational complexity or simply complexity of an algorithm is the amount of resources required to run it. Particular focus is given to computation time (generally measured by the number of needed elementary operations) and memory storage requirements. The complexity of a problem is the complexity of the best algorithms that allow solving the problem.\\nThe study of the complexity of explicitly given algorithms is called analysis of algorithms, while the study of the complexity of problems is called computational complexity theory. Both areas are highly related, as the complexity of an algorithm is always an upper bound on the complexity of the problem solved by this algorithm. Moreover, for designing efficient algorithms, it is often fundamental to compare the complexity of a specific algorithm to the complexity of the problem to be solved. Also, in most cases, the only thing that is known about the complexity of a problem is that it is lower than the complexity of the most efficient known algorithms. Therefore, there is a large overlap between analysis of algorithms and complexity theory.\\nAs the amount of resources required to run an algorithm generally varies with the size of the input, the complexity is typically expressed as a function n → f(n), where n is the size of the input and f(n) is either the worst-case complexity (the maximum of the amount of resources that are needed over all inputs of size n) or the average-case complexity (the average of the amount of resources over all inputs of size n). Time complexity is generally expressed as the number of required elementary operations on an input of size n, where elementary operations are assumed to take a constant amount of time on a given computer and change only by a constant factor when run on a different computer. Space complexity is generally expressed as the amount of memory required by an algorithm on an input of size n.\\n\\n\\n== Resources ==\\n\\n\\n=== Time ===\\nThe resource that is most commonly considered is time. When \"complexity\" is used without qualification, this generally means time complexity.\\nThe usual units of time (seconds, minutes etc.) are not used in complexity theory because they are too dependent on the choice of a specific computer and on the evolution of technology. For instance, a computer today can execute an algorithm significantly faster than a computer from the 1960s; however, this is not an intrinsic feature of the algorithm but rather a consequence of technological advances in computer hardware. Complexity theory seeks to quantify the intrinsic time requirements of algorithms, that is, the basic time constraints an algorithm would place on any computer. This is achieved by counting the number of elementary operations that are executed during the computation. These operations are assumed to take constant time (that is, not affected by the size of the input) on a given machine, and are often called steps.\\n\\n\\n=== Bit complexity ===\\n\\nFormally, the bit complexity refers to the number of operations on bits that are needed for running an algorithm. With most models of computation, it equals the time complexity up to a constant factor. On computers, the number of operations on machine words that are needed is also proportional to the bit complexity. So, the time complexity and the bit complexity are equivalent  for realistic models of computation.\\n\\n\\n=== Space ===\\nAnother important resource is the size of computer memory that is needed for running algorithms.\\n\\n\\n=== Communication ===\\n\\nFor the class of distributed algorithms that are commonly executed by multiple, interacting parties, the resource that is of most interest is the communication complexity. It is the necessary amount of communication between the executing parties.\\n\\n\\n=== Others ===\\nThe number of arithmetic operations is another resource that is commonly used. In this case, one talks of arithmetic complexity. If one knows an upper bound on the size of the binary representa',\n",
       " 'Computability theory, also known as recursion theory, is a branch of mathematical logic, computer science, and the theory of computation that originated in the 1930s with the study of computable functions and Turing degrees. The field has since expanded to include the study of generalized computability and definability. In these areas, computability theory overlaps with proof theory and effective descriptive set theory.\\nBasic questions addressed by computability theory include:\\n\\nWhat does it mean for a function on the natural numbers to be computable?\\nHow can noncomputable functions be classified into a hierarchy based on their level of noncomputability?\\nAlthough there is considerable overlap in terms of knowledge and methods, mathematical computability theorists study the theory of relative computability, reducibility notions, and degree structures; those in the computer science field focus on the theory of subrecursive hierarchies, formal methods, and formal languages. The study of which mathematical constructions can be effectively performed is sometimes called recursive mathematics.\\n\\n\\n== Introduction ==\\n\\nComputability theory originated in the 1930s, with the work of Kurt Gödel, Alonzo Church, Rózsa Péter, Alan Turing, Stephen Kleene, and Emil Post.\\nThe fundamental results the researchers obtained established Turing computability as the correct formalization of the informal idea of effective calculation. In 1952, these results led Kleene to coin the two names \"Church\\'s thesis\":\\u200a300\\u200a and \"Turing\\'s thesis\".:\\u200a376\\u200a Nowadays these are often considered as a single hypothesis, the Church–Turing thesis, which states that any function that is computable by an algorithm is a computable function. Although initially skeptical, by 1946 Gödel argued in favor of this thesis::\\u200a84\\u200a\\n\\n\"Tarski has stressed in his lecture (and I think justly) the great importance of the concept of general recursiveness (or Turing\\'s computability). It seems to me that this importance is largely due to the fact that with this concept one has for the first time succeeded in giving an absolute notion to an interesting epistemological notion, i.e., one not depending on the formalism chosen.\":\\u200a84\\u200a\\nWith a definition of effective calculation came the first proofs that there are problems in mathematics that cannot be effectively decided. In 1936, Church and Turing were inspired by techniques used by Gödel to prove his incompleteness theorems - in 1931, Gödel independently demonstrated that the Entscheidungsproblem is not effectively decidable. This result showed that there is no algorithmic procedure that can correctly decide whether arbitrary mathematical propositions are true or false.\\nMany problems in mathematics have been shown to be undecidable after these initial examples were established. In 1947, Markov and Post published independent papers showing that the word problem for semigroups cannot be effectively decided. Extending this result, Pyotr Novikov and William Boone showed independently in the 1950s that the word problem for groups is not effectively solvable: there is no effective procedure that, given a word in a finitely presented group, will decide whether the element represented by the word is the identity element of the group. In 1970, Yuri Matiyasevich proved (using results of Julia Robinson) Matiyasevich\\'s theorem, which implies that Hilbert\\'s tenth problem has no effective solution; this problem asked whether there is an effective procedure to decide whether a Diophantine equation over the integers has a solution in the integers.\\n\\n\\n== Turing computability ==\\nThe main form of computability studied in the field was introduced by Turing in 1936. A set of natural numbers is said to be a computable set (also called a decidable, recursive, or Turing computable set) if there is a Turing machine that, given a number n, halts with output 1 if n is in the set and halts with output 0 if n is not in the set.

This bound, however, can be avoided if there is access to quantum memory. Computational algorithms can then be designed that require arbitrarily small amounts of energy/time per one elementary computation step.\\n\\n\\n=== Energy supply ===\\nLandauer\\'s principle defines a lower theoretical limit for energy consumption: kT ln 2 consumed per irreversible state change, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the operating temperature of the computer.  Reversible computing is not subject to this lower bound.  T cannot, even in theory, be made lower than 3 kelvins, the approximate temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, without spending more energy on cooling than is saved in computation. However, on a timescale of 109 – 1010 years, the cosmic microwave background radiation will be decreasing exponentially, which has been argued to eventually enable 1030 as much computations per unit of energy.  Important parts of this argument have been disputed.\\n\\n\\n== Building devices that approach physical limits ==\\nSeveral methods have been proposed for producing computing devices or data storage devices that approach physical and practical limits:\\n\\nA cold degenerate star could conceivably be used as a giant data storage device, by carefully perturbing it to various excited states, in the same manner as an atom or quantum well used for these purposes. Such a star would have to be artificially constructed, as no natural degenerate stars will cool to this temperature for an extremely long time. It is also possible that nucleons on the surface of neutron stars could form complex \"molecules\", which some have suggested might be used for computing purposes, creating a type of computronium based on femtotechnology, which would be faster and denser than computronium based on nanotechnology.\\nIt may be possible to use a black hole as a data storage or computing device, if a practical mechanism for extraction of contained information can be found. Such extraction may in principle be possible (Stephen Hawking\\'s proposed resolution to the black hole information paradox). This would achieve storage density exactly equal to the Bekenstein bound. Seth Lloyd calculated the computational abilities of an \"ultimate laptop\" formed by compressing a kilogram of matter into a black hole of radius 1.485 × 10−27 meters, concluding that it would only last about 10−19 seconds before evaporating due to Hawking radiation, but that during this brief time it could compute at a rate of about 5 × 1050 operations per second, ultimately performing about 1032 operations on 1016 bits (~1 PB). Lloyd notes that \"Interestingly, although this hypothetical computation is performed at ultra-high densities and speeds, the total number of bits available to be processed is not far from the number available to current computers operating in more familiar surroundings.\"\\nIn The Singularity Is Near, Ray Kurzweil cites the calculations of Seth Lloyd that a universa',\n",
       " 'Algorithmic game theory (AGT) is an area in the intersection of game theory and computer science, with the objective of understanding and design of algorithms in strategic environments.\\nTypically, in Algorithmic Game Theory problems, the input to a given algorithm is distributed among many players who have a personal interest in the output. In those situations, the agents might not report the input truthfully because of their own personal interests. We can see Algorithmic Game Theory from two perspectives:\\n\\nAnalysis: given the currently implemented algorithms, analyze them using Game Theory tools (e.g., calculate and prove properties on their Nash equilibria, price of anarchy, and best-response dynamics).\\nDesign: design games that have both good game-theoretical and algorithmic properties.

As they claim in the abstract:\\n\\nWe consider algorithmic problems in a distributed setting where the participants cannot be assumed to follow the algorithm but rather their own self-interest. As such participants, termed agents, are capable of manipulating the algorithm, the algorithm designer should ensure in advance that the agents’ interests are best served by behaving correctly.\\nFollowing notions from the field of mechanism design, we suggest a framework for studying such algorithms. In this model the algorithmic solution is adorned with payments to the participants and is termed a mechanism. The payments should be carefully chosen as to motivate all participants to act as the algorithm designer wishes. We apply the standard tools of mechanism design to algorithmic problems and in particular to the shortest path problem.\\nThis paper coined the term algorithmic mechanism design and was recognized by the 2012 Gödel Prize committee as one of \"three papers laying foundation of growth in Algorithmic Game Theory\".\\n\\n\\n=== Price of Anarchy ===\\n\\nThe other two papers cited in the 2012 Gödel Prize for fundamental contributions to Algorithmic Game Theory introduced and developed the concept of \"Price of Anarchy\". \\nIn their 1999 paper \"Worst-case Equilibria\", Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou proposed a new measure of the degradation of system efficiency due to the selfish behavior of its agents: the ratio of between system efficiency at an optimal configuration, and its efficiency at the worst Nash equilibrium.

The computational nature of the Internet allowed for the use of computational tools in this new emerging economy. On the other hand, the Internet itself is the outcome of actions of many. This was new to the classic, ‘top-down’ approach to computation that held till then. Thus, game theory is a natural way to view the Internet and interactions within it, both human and mechanical.\\nGame theory studies equilibria (such as the Nash equilibrium). An equilibrium is generally defined as a state in which no player has an incentive to change their strategy. Equilibria are found in several fields related to the Internet, for instance financial interactions and communication load-balancing. Game theory provides tools to analyze equilibria, and a common approach is then to ‘find the game’—that is, to formalize specific Internet interactions as a game, and to derive the associated equilibria.\\nRephrasing problems in terms of games allows the analysis of Internet-based interac',\n",

       " 'Computational mathematics is the study of the interaction between mathematics and calculations done by a computer. \\nA large part of computational mathematics consists roughly of using mathematics for allowing and improving computer computation in areas of science and engineering where mathematics are useful. This involves in particular algorithm design, computational complexity, numerical methods and computer algebra.\\nComputational mathematics refers also to the use of computers for mathematics itself. This includes mathematical experimentation for establishing conjectures (particularly in number theory), the use of computers for proving theorems (for example the four color theorem), and the design and use of proof assistants.\\n\\n\\n== Areas of computational mathematics ==\\nComputational mathematics emerged as a distinct part of applied mathematics by the early 1950s.

       " 'David Elieser Deutsch  ( DOYTCH; born 18 May 1953) is a British physicist at the University of Oxford. He is a visiting professor in the Department of Atomic and Laser Physics at the Centre for Quantum Computation (CQC) in the Clarendon Laboratory of the University of Oxford. He pioneered the field of quantum computation by formulating a description for a quantum Turing machine, as well as specifying an algorithm designed to run on a quantum computer. He is a proponent of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nDeutsch was born to a Jewish family in Haifa, Israel on 18 May 1953, the son of Oskar and Tikva Deutsch. In London, David attended Geneva House school in Cricklewood (his parents owned and ran the Alma restaurant on Cricklewood Broadway), followed by William Ellis School in Highgate before reading Natural Sciences at Clare College, Cambridge and taking Part III of the Mathematical Tripos. He went on to Wolfson College, Oxford for his doctorate in theoretical physics, about quantum field theory in curved space-time, supervised by Dennis Sciama and Philip Candelas.\\n\\n\\n== Career and research ==\\nHis work on quantum algorithms began with a 1985 paper, later expanded in 1992 along with Richard Jozsa, to produce the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm, one of the first examples of a quantum algorithm that is exponentially faster than any possible deterministic classical algorithm. In his nomination for election as a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2008, his contributions were described as:\\n\\n[having] laid the foundations of the quantum theory of computation, and has subsequently made or participated in many of the most important advances in the field, including the discovery of the first quantum algorithms, the theory of quantum logic gates and quantum computational networks, the first quantum error-correction scheme, and several fundamental quantum universality results. He has set the agenda for worldwide research efforts in this new, interdisciplinary field, made progress in understanding its philosophical implications (via a variant of the many-universes interpretation) and made it comprehensible to the general public, notably in his book The Fabric of Reality.\\nSince 2012, he has been working on constructor theory, an attempt at generalizing the quantum theory of computation to cover not just computation but all physical processes. Together with Chiara Marletto, he published a paper in December 2014 entitled Constructor theory of information, that conjectures that information can be expressed solely in terms of which transformations of physical systems are possible and which are impossible.\\n\\n\\n=== The Fabric of Reality ===\\n\\nIn his 1997 book The Fabric of Reality, Deutsch details his \"Theory of Everything\". It aims not at the reduction of everything to particle physics, but rather mutual support among multiversal, computational, epistemological, and evolutionary principles. His theory of everything is somewhat emergentist rather than reductive. There are four strands to his theory:\\n\\nHugh Everett\\'s many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics, \"the first and most important of the four strands.\"\\nKarl Popper\\'s epistemology, especially its anti-inductivism and requiring a realist (non-instrumental) interpretation of scientific theories, as well as its emphasis on taking seriously those bold conjectures that resist falsification.\\nAlan Turing\\'s theory of computation, especially as developed in Deutsch\\'s Turing principle, in which the Universal Turing machine is replaced by Deutsch\\'s universal quantum computer. (\"The theory of computation is now the quantum theory of computation.\")\\nRichard Dawkins\\' refinement of Darwinian evolutionary theory and the modern evolutionary synthesis, especially the ideas of replicator and meme as they integrate with Popperian problem-solving (the epistemological strand).\\n\\n\\n=== Invariants ===\\nIn a 2009 TED talk, Deutsch expounded a criterion for scientific explanatio',\n",
       " 'Computability is the ability to solve a problem in an effective manner. It is a key topic of the field of computability theory within mathematical logic and the theory of computation within computer science. The computability of a problem is closely linked to the existence of an algorithm to solve the problem.\\nThe most widely studied models of computability are the Turing-computable and μ-recursive functions, and the lambda calculus, all of which have computationally equivalent power. Other forms of computability are studied as well: computability notions weaker than Turing machines are studied in automata theory, while computability notions stronger than Turing machines are studied in the field of hypercomputation.\\n\\n\\n== Problems ==\\nA central idea in computability is that of a (computational) problem, which is a task whose computability can be explored.\\nThere are two key types of problems:\\n\\nA decision problem fixes a set S, which may be a set of strings, natural numbers, or other objects taken from some larger set U. A particular instance of the problem is to decide, given an element u of U, whether u is in S. For example, let U be the set of natural numbers and S the set of prime numbers. The corresponding decision problem corresponds to primality testing.\\nA function problem consists of a function f from a set U to a set V. An instance of the problem is to compute, given an element u in U, the corresponding element f(u) in V.  For example, U and V may be the set of all finite binary strings, and f may take a string and return the string obtained by reversing the digits of the input (so f(0101) = 1010).\\nOther types of problems include search problems and optimization problems.\\nOne goal of computability theory is to determine which problems, or classes of problems, can be solved in each model of computation.\\n\\n\\n== Formal models of computation ==\\n\\nA model of computation is a formal description of a particular type of computational process. The description often takes the form of an abstract machine that is meant to perform the task at hand. General models of computation equivalent to a Turing machine (see Church–Turing thesis) include:\\n\\nLambda calculus\\nA computation consists of an initial lambda expression (or two if you want to separate the function and its input) plus a finite sequence of lambda terms, each deduced from the preceding term by one application of beta reduction.\\nCombinatory logic\\nA concept which has many similarities to \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        λ\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\lambda }\\n  \\n-calculus, but also important differences exist (e.g. fixed point combinator Y has normal form in combinatory logic but not in \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        λ\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\lambda }\\n  \\n-calculus). Combinatory logic was developed with great ambitions: understanding the nature of paradoxes, making foundations of mathematics more economic (conceptually), eliminating the notion of variables (thus clarifying their role in mathematics).\\nμ-recursive functions\\nA computation consists of a μ-recursive function, i.e. its defining sequence, any input value(s) and a sequence of recursive functions appearing in the defining sequence with inputs and outputs. Thus, if in the defining sequence of a recursive function f(x) the functions g(x) and h(x,y) appear, then terms of the form g(5) = 7 or h(3,2) = 10 might appear.  Each entry in this sequence needs to be an application of a basic function or follow from the entries above by using composition, primitive recursion or μ-recursion.  For instance if f(x) = h(x,g(x)), then for f(5) = 3 to appear, terms like g(5) = 6 and h(5,6) = 3 must occur above. The computation terminates only if the final term gives the value of the recursive function applied to the inputs.\\nString rewriting systems\\nIncludes Markov algorithms, that use grammar-like rules to operate on strings of symbols; also Post canonical system.\\nRegister machine\\nA theoretical idealization of a computer. There are several variants',\n",

This field is mainly focused on mathematical structures called automata and is crucial for the purpose of studying processes occurring in discrete systems.\\nWhat is Automata Theory?\\nIn automata theory, scientists and engineers can predict the behavior of computing systems thereby improving problem-solving approaches. Originally developed to describe and explain the dynamics of systems, automata theory is the theoretical base of the formal languages theory, grammar, and computational complexity.\\nBasic Terminologies of Theory of Computation\\nNow, let’s understand the basic terminologies, which are important and frequently used in the Theory of Computation.\\xa0\\nSymbol\\nA symbol (often also called a character) is the smallest building block, which can be any alphabet, letter, or picture.\\xa0\\n\\nAlphabets (Σ)\\nAlphabets are a set of symbols, which are always finite.\\xa0\\n\\nString\\xa0\\nA string is a finite sequence of symbols from some alphabet. A string is generally denoted as w and the length of a string is denoted as |w|.\\xa0\\nEmpty string is the string with zero occurrence of symbols, represented as ε.\\nNumber of Strings (of length 2) that can be generated over the alphabet {a, b}:                     -   -                     a   a                     a   b                     b   a                     b   bLength of String |w| = 2Number of Strings = 4Conclusion:For alphabet {a, b} with length n, number of strings can be generated = 2n.\\n__mask-blockquote__index=1__\\n\\nThe Theory of Computation explores automata, languages, and complexity. If you want to dive deeper into this subject for GATE, the GATE CS Self-Paced Course covers it extensively.\\n\\nClosure Representation in TOC\\nL+: It is a Positive Closure that represents a set of all strings except Null or ε-strings.\\nL*: It is “Kleene Closure“, that represents the occurrence of certain alphabets for given language alphabets from zero to the infinite number of times. In which ε-string is also included.\\nFrom the above two statements, it can be concluded that:\\nL* = εL+\\nExample:(a) Regular expression for language accepting all combination of g\\'s over Σ={g}:                                         R = g*                               R={ε,g,gg,ggg,gggg,ggggg,...}(b) Regular Expression for language accepting all combination of g\\'s over Σ={g} : R = g+                               R={g,gg,ggg,gggg,ggggg,gggggg,...}\\nNote: Σ* is a set of all possible strings(often power set(need not be unique here or we can say multiset) of string) So this implies that language is a subset of Σ*.This is also called a “Kleene Star”.\\nKleene Star is also called a “Kleene Operator” or “Kleene Closure”. Engineers and IT professionals make use of Kleene Star to achieve all set of strings which is to be included from a given set of characters or symbols. It is one kind of Unary operator. In Kleene Star methodology all individual elements of a given string must be present but additional elements or combinations of these alphabets can be included to any extent.\\nExample:Input String: \"GFG\".Σ* = { ε,\"GFG\",\"GGFG\",\"GGFG\",\"GFGGGGGGGG\",\"GGGGGGGGFFFFFFFFFGGGGGGGG\",...}  (Kleene Star is an infinite set but if we provide any grammar rules then it can work as a finite set.Please note that we can include ε string also in given Kleene star representation.)\\nLanguage\\nA language is a set of strings, chosen from some Σ* or we can say- ‘A language is a subset of Σ* ‘. A language that can be formed over ‘ Σ ‘ can be Finite or Infinite.\\nExample of Finite Language:           L1 = { set of string of 2 }         L1 = { xy, yx, xx, yy }Example of Infinite Language:         L1 = { set of all strings starts with \\'b\\' }         L1 = { babb, baa, ba, bbb, baab, ....... }\\nConclusion\\nIt is an important branch of computation that is concerned with formal languages, and automata theory in particular. It provides a basis for other courses such as Turing machines and computational complexity that are very important in computer science.\\nIntroduction of Theory of Computation – FAQs\\nWhat is the relevance of the automata theory in computer science?\\n\\nAutomata theory is used in modeling computational problems hence enhancing the understanding and design of systems such as compilers, interpreters among others.\\n\\nwhat is the purpose of using Kleene Star in the study of formal languages?\\n\\nThe Kleene Star extends symbols from a given alphabet where one is able to create infinite strings from it or even the null string.\\n\\nIs it possible to implement automata theory into real life?\\n\\nOf course, automata theory has found its use in certain areas like compiler design, artificial intelligence, network security and natural language processing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nabhishek1 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Follow \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImprove\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrevious Article\\n\\n\\n\\nAutomata Tutorial\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNext Article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChomsky Hierarchy in Theory of Computation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead More\\n\\n\\n\\nSimilar Reads\\n\\n\\n\\nIntroduction to Computation Complex Theory\\nBroad Overview : Complexity theory, in a nutshell, a complexity word is a quite fancy word, literally, it sounds complex, but it is not an intimidating topic.

       "['In theoretical computer science and mathematics, the theory of computation is the branch that deals with what problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm, how efficiently they can be solved or to what degree (e.g., approximate solutions versus precise ones).  The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and formal languages, computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question: \"What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?\".\\nIn order to perform a rigorous study of computation, computer scientists work with a mathematical abstraction of computers called a model of computation. There are several models in use, but the most commonly examined is the Turing machine. Computer scientists study the Turing machine because it is simple to formulate, can be analyzed and used to prove results, and because it represents what many consider the most powerful possible \"reasonable\" model of computation (see Church–Turing thesis). It might seem that the potentially infinite memory capacity is an unrealizable attribute, but any decidable problem solved by a Turing machine will always require only a finite amount of memory. So in principle, any problem that can be solved (decided) by a Turing machine can be solved by a computer that has a finite amount of memory.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe theory of computation can be considered the creation of models of all kinds in the field of computer science. Therefore, mathematics and logic are used. In the last century, it separated from mathematics and became an independent academic discipline with its own conferences such as FOCS in 1960 and STOC in 1969, and its own awards such as the IMU Abacus Medal (established in 1981 as the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize), the Gödel Prize, established in 1993, and the Knuth Prize, established in 1996.\\nSome pioneers of the theory of computation were Ramon Llull, Alonzo Church, Kurt Gödel, Alan Turing, Stephen Kleene, Rózsa Péter, John von Neumann and Claude Shannon.\\n\\n\\n== Branches ==\\n\\n\\n=== Automata theory ===\\n\\nAutomata theory is the study of abstract machines (or more appropriately, abstract \\'mathematical\\' machines or systems) and the computational problems that can be solved using these machines. These abstract machines are called automata. Automata comes from the Greek word (Αυτόματα) which means that something is doing something by itself.\\nAutomata theory is also closely related to formal language theory, as the automata are often classified by the class of formal languages they are able to recognize. An automaton can be a finite representation of a formal language that may be an infinite set. Automata are used as theoretical models for computing machines, and are used for proofs about computability.\\n\\n\\n==== Formal Language theory ====\\n\\nLanguage theory is a branch of mathematics concerned with describing languages as a set of operations over an alphabet. It is closely linked with automata theory, as automata are used to generate and recognize formal languages. There are several classes of formal languages, each allowing more complex language specification than the one before it, i.e. Chomsky hierarchy, and each corresponding to a class of automata which recognizes it. Because automata are used as models for computation, formal languages are the preferred mode of specification for any problem that must be computed.\\n\\n\\n=== Computability theory ===\\n\\nComputability theory deals primarily with the question of the extent to which a problem is solvable on a computer. The statement that the halting problem cannot be solved by a Turing machine is one of the most important results in computability theory, as it is an example of a concrete problem that is both easy to formulate and impossible to solve using a Turing machine.  Much of computability theory builds on the halting problem result.\\nAnother important step in computability theory was Rice\\'s theorem, which states that for all non-tr\\n\\nIn theoretical computer science and mathematics, computational complexity theory focuses on classifying computational problems according to their resource usage, and explores the relationships between these classifications. A computational problem is a task solved by a computer. A computation problem is solvable by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.\\nA problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used. The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying their computational complexity, i.e., the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. Other measures of complexity are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in communication complexity), the number of gates in a circuit (used in circuit complexity) and the number of processors (used in parallel computing). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do. The P versus NP problem, one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, is part of the field of computational complexity.\\nClosely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory. A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem. More precisely, computational complexity theory tries to classify problems that can or cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources. In turn, imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory: the latter theory asks what kinds of problems can, in principle, be solved algorithmically.\\n\\n\\n== Computational problems ==\\n\\n\\n=== Problem instances ===\\nA computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of instances together with a set (possibly empty) of solutions for every instance. The input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance, and should not be confused with the problem itself. In computational complexity theory, a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved. In contrast, an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance, which can serve as the input for a decision problem. For example, consider the problem of primality testing. The instance is a number (e.g., 15) and the solution is \"yes\" if the number is prime and \"no\" otherwise (in this case, 15 is not prime and the answer is \"no\"). Stated another way, the instance is a particular input to the problem, and the solution is the output corresponding to the given input.\\nTo further highlight the difference between a problem and an instance, consider the following instance of the decision version of the travelling salesman problem: Is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of Germany\\'s 15 largest cities? The quantitative answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem, such as asking for a round trip through all sites in Milan whose total length is at most 10 km. For this reason, complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances.\\n\\n\\n=== Representing problem instances ===\\nWhen considering computational problems, a problem instance is a string over an alphabet. Usually, the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet (i.e., the set {0,1}), and thus the strings are bitstrings. As in a real-world computer, mathematical objects other than bitstrings must be suitably encoded. For example, integers can be represented in binary notation, and graphs can be encoded directly via their adjacency matrices, o',\n",
       " 'In philosophy of mind, the computational theory of mind (CTM), also known as computationalism, is a family of views that hold that the human mind is an information processing system and that cognition and consciousness together are a form of computation. It is closely related to functionalism, a broader theory that defines mental states by what they do rather than what they\\'re made of.\\nWarren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943) were the first to suggest that neural activity is computational. They argued that neural computations explain cognition. The theory was proposed in its modern form by Hilary Putnam in 1967, and developed by his PhD student, philosopher, and cognitive scientist Jerry Fodor in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. It was later criticized in the 1990s by Putnam himself, John Searle, and others.\\nThe computational theory of mind holds that the mind is a computational system that is realized (i.e. physically implemented) by neural activity in the brain. The theory can be elaborated in many ways and varies largely based on how the term computation is understood. Computation is commonly understood in terms of Turing machines which manipulate symbols according to a rule, in combination with the internal state of the machine. The critical aspect of such a computational model is that we can abstract away from particular physical details of the machine that is implementing the computation. For example, the appropriate computation could be implemented either by silicon chips or biological neural networks, so long as there is a series of outputs based on manipulations of inputs and internal states, performed according to a rule. CTM therefore holds that the mind is not simply analogous to a computer program, but that it is literally a computational system.\\nComputational theories of mind are often said to require mental representation because \\'input\\' into a computation comes in the form of symbols or representations of other objects. A computer cannot compute an actual object but must interpret and represent the object in some form and then compute the representation. The computational theory of mind is related to the representational theory of mind in that they both require that mental states are representations. However, the representational theory of mind shifts the focus to the symbols being manipulated. This approach better accounts for systematicity and productivity. In Fodor\\'s original views, the computational theory of mind is also related to the language of thought. The language of thought theory allows the mind to process more complex representations with the help of semantics.\\nRecent work has suggested that we make a distinction between the mind and cognition. Building from the tradition of McCulloch and Pitts, the computational theory of cognition (CTC) states that neural computations explain cognition. The computational theory of mind asserts that not only cognition, but also phenomenal consciousness or qualia, are computational. That is to say, CTM entails CTC. While phenomenal consciousness could fulfill some other functional role, computational theory of cognition leaves open the possibility that some aspects of the mind could be non-computational. CTC, therefore, provides an important explanatory framework for understanding neural networks, while avoiding counter-arguments that center around phenomenal consciousness.\\n\\n\\n== \"Computer metaphor\" ==\\nComputational theory of mind is not the same as the computer metaphor, comparing the mind to a modern-day digital computer. Computational theory just uses some of the same principles as those found in digital computing. While the computer metaphor draws an analogy between the mind as software and the brain as hardware, CTM is the claim that the mind is a computational system. More specifically, it states that a computational simulation of a mind is sufficient for the actual presence of a mind, and that a mind truly can be simulated computationally.\\n\\'Computational system\\' \\n\\nIntroduction to the Theory of Computation (ISBN 0-534-95097-3) is a textbook in theoretical computer science, written by Michael Sipser and first published by PWS Publishing in 1997.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nIntroduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation by John Hopcroft and Jeffrey Ullman, an older textbook in the same field\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nInformation on Introduction to the Theory of Computation (by Michael Sipser)\\n\\nA computation is any type of arithmetic or non-arithmetic calculation that is well-defined. Common examples of computation are mathematical equation solving and the execution of computer algorithms.\\nMechanical or electronic devices (or, historically, people) that perform computations are known as computers. \\nComputer science is an academic field that involves the study of computation.\\n\\n\\n== Introduction ==\\nThe notion that mathematical statements should be \\'well-defined\\' had been argued by mathematicians since at least the 1600s, but agreement on a suitable definition proved elusive. A candidate definition was proposed independently by several mathematicians in the 1930s. The best-known variant was formalised by the mathematician Alan Turing, who defined a well-defined statement or calculation as any statement that could be expressed in terms of the initialisation parameters of a Turing machine. Other (mathematically equivalent) definitions include Alonzo Church\\'s lambda-definability, Herbrand-Gödel-Kleene\\'s general recursiveness and Emil Post\\'s 1-definability.\\nToday, any formal statement or calculation that exhibits this quality of well-definedness is termed computable, while the statement or calculation itself is referred to as a computation.\\nTuring\\'s definition apportioned \"well-definedness\" to a very large class of mathematical statements, including all well-formed algebraic statements, and all statements written in modern computer programming languages.\\nDespite the widespread uptake of this definition, there are some mathematical concepts that have no well-defined characterisation under this definition. This includes the halting problem and the busy beaver game. It remains an open question as to whether there exists a more powerful definition of \\'well-defined\\' that is able to capture both computable and \\'non-computable\\' statements.\\nSome examples of mathematical statements that are computable include:\\n\\nAll statements characterised in modern programming languages, including C++, Python, and Java.\\nAll calculations carried by an electronic computer, calculator or abacus.\\nAll calculations carried out on an analytical engine.\\nAll calculations carried out on a Turing Machine.\\nThe majority of mathematical statements and calculations given in maths textbooks.\\nSome examples of mathematical statements that are not computable include:\\n\\nCalculations or statements which are ill-defined, such that they cannot be unambiguously encoded into a Turing machine: (\"Paul loves me twice as much as Joe\").\\nProblem statements which do appear to be well-defined, but for which it can be proved that no Turing machine exists to solve them (such as the halting problem).\\n\\n\\n=== The Physical process of computation ===\\nComputation can be seen as a purely physical process occurring inside a closed physical system called a computer. Turing\\'s 1937 proof, On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem, demonstrated that there is a formal equivalence between computable statements and particular physical systems, commonly called computers. Examples of such physical systems are: Turing machines, human mathematicians following strict rules, digital computers, mechanical computers, analog computers and others.\\n\\n\\n== Alternative accounts of computation ==\\n\\n\\n=== The mapping account ===\\nAn alternative account of computation is found throughout the works of Hilary Putnam and others. Peter Godfrey-Smith has dubbed this the \"simple mapping account.\" Gualtiero Piccinini\\'s summary of this account states that a physical system can be said to perform a specific computation when there is a mapping between the state of that system and the computation such that the \"microphysical states [of the system] mirror the state transitions between the computational states.\"\\n\\n\\n=== The semantic account ===\\nPhilosophers such as Jerry Fodor have suggested various accounts of computation with the restriction that semantic content be a necessary condition for computation (',\n",

Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software). \\nAlgorithms and data structures are central to computer science.\\nThe theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them. The fields of cryptography and computer security involve studying the means for secure communication and preventing security vulnerabilities. Computer graphics and computational geometry address the generation of images. Programming language theory considers different ways to describe computational processes, and database theory concerns the management of repositories of data. Human–computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software. Areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems. Computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment. Artificial intelligence and machine learning aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals. Within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process image and video data, while natural language processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.\\nThe fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated. The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern digital computer. Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity, aiding in computations such as multiplication and division. Algorithms for performing computations have existed since antiquity, even before the development of sophisticated computing equipment.\\nWilhelm Schickard designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator in 1623. In 1673, Gottfried Leibniz demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator, called the Stepped Reckoner. Leibniz may be considered the first computer scientist and information theorist, because of various reasons, including the fact that he documented the binary number system. In 1820, Thomas de Colmar launched the mechanical calculator industry when he invented his simplified arithmometer, the first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. Charles Babbage started the design of the first automatic mechanical calculator, his Difference Engine, in 1822, which eventually gave him the idea of the first programmable mechanical calculator, his Analytical Engine. He started developing this machine in 1834, and \"in less than two years, he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer\". \"A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the Jacquard loom\" making it infinitely programmable. In 1843, during the translation of a French article on the Analytical Engine, Ada Lovelace wrote, in one of the many notes she included, an algorithm to compute the Bernoulli numbers, which is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer. Around 1885, Herman Hollerith invented the tabulator, which used punched cards to process statistical information; eventually his company became part of IBM. Following Babbage, although unaware of his earlier work, Percy Ludgate in 1909 published the 2nd of the only two designs for mechanical analytical engines in history. In 1914\\n\\nIn computer science, and more specifically in computability theory and computational complexity theory, a model of computation is a model which describes how an output of a mathematical function is computed given an input. A model describes how units of computations, memories, and communications are organized. The computational complexity of an algorithm can be measured given a model of computation. Using a model allows studying the performance of algorithms independently of the variations that are specific to particular implementations and specific technology.\\n\\n\\n== Models ==\\nModels of computation can be classified into three categories: sequential models, functional models, and concurrent models.\\n\\n\\n=== Sequential models ===\\nSequential models include:\\n\\nFinite state machines\\nPost machines (Post–Turing machines and tag machines).\\nPushdown automata\\nRegister machines\\nRandom-access machines\\nTuring machines\\nDecision tree model\\n\\n\\n=== Functional models ===\\nFunctional models include:\\n\\nAbstract rewriting systems\\nCombinatory logic\\nGeneral recursive functions\\nLambda calculus\\n\\n\\n=== Concurrent models ===\\nConcurrent models include:\\n\\nActor model\\nCellular automaton\\nInteraction nets\\nKahn process networks\\nLogic gates and digital circuits\\nPetri nets\\nProcess calculus\\nSynchronous Data Flow\\nSome of these models have both deterministic and  nondeterministic variants. Nondeterministic models  correspond to limits of certain sequences of finite computers, but do not correspond to any subset of finite computers; they are used in the study of computational complexity of algorithms.\\nModels differ in their expressive power; for example, each function that can be computed by a Finite state machine can also be computed by a Turing machine, but not vice versa.\\n\\n\\n== Uses ==\\nIn the field of runtime analysis of algorithms, it is common to specify a  computational model in terms of primitive operations allowed which have unit cost, or simply unit-cost operations. A commonly used example is the random-access machine, which has unit cost for read and write access to all of its memory cells. In this respect, it differs from the above-mentioned Turing machine model.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nStack machine (0-operand machine)\\nAccumulator machine (1-operand machine)\\nRegister machine (2,3,... operand machine)\\nRandom-access machine\\nAbstract machine\\nCell-probe model\\nRobertson–Webb query model\\nChomsky hierarchy\\nTuring completeness\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nFernández, Maribel (2009).

In supervised learning, an algorithm is given samples that are labeled in some useful way.  For example, the samples might be descriptions of mushrooms, and the labels could be whether or not the mushrooms are edible.  The algorithm takes these previously labeled samples and uses them to induce a classifier.  This classifier is a function that assigns labels to samples, including samples that have not been seen previously by the algorithm.  The goal of the supervised learning algorithm is to optimize some measure of performance such as minimizing the number of mistakes made on new samples.\\nIn addition to performance bounds, computational learning theory studies the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In\\ncomputational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. There are two kinds of time\\ncomplexity results:\\n\\nPositive results – Showing that a certain class of functions is learnable in polynomial time.\\nNegative results – Showing that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.\\nNegative results often rely on commonly believed, but yet unproven assumptions, such as:\\n\\nComputational complexity – P ≠ NP (the P versus NP problem);\\nCryptographic – One-way functions exist.\\nThere are several different approaches to computational learning theory based on making different assumptions about the inference principles used to generalise from limited data. This includes different definitions of probability (see frequency probability, Bayesian probability) and different assumptions on the generation of samples. The different approaches include:\\n\\nExact learning, proposed by Dana Angluin;\\nProbably approximately correct learning (PAC learning), proposed by Leslie Valiant;\\nVC theory, proposed by Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis;\\nInductive inference as developed by Ray Solomonoff;\\nAlgorithmic learning theory, from the work of E. Mark Gold;\\nOnline machine learning, from the work of Nick Littlestone.\\nWhile its primary goal is to understand learning abstractly, computational learning theory has led to the development of practical algorithms. For example, PAC theory inspired boosting, VC theory led to support vector machines, and Bayesian inference led to belief networks.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nError tolerance (PAC learning)\\nGrammar induction\\nInformation theory\\nOccam learning\\nStability (learning theory)\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nA description of some of these publications is given at important publications in machine learning.',\n",

The ACM\\'s Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT) provides the following description:\\n\\nTCS covers a wide variety of topics including algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, parallel and distributed computation, probabilistic computation, quantum computation, automata theory, information theory, cryptography, program semantics and verification, algorithmic game theory, machine learning, computational biology, computational economics, computational geometry, and computational number theory and algebra. Work in this field is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and rigor.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nWhile logical inference and mathematical proof had existed previously, in 1931 Kurt Gödel proved with his incompleteness theorem that there are fundamental limitations on what statements could be proved or disproved.\\nInformation theory was added to the field with a 1948 mathematical theory of communication by Claude Shannon. In the same decade, Donald Hebb introduced a mathematical model of learning in the brain. With mounting biological data supporting this hypothesis with some modification, the fields of neural networks and parallel distributed processing were established. In 1971, Stephen Cook and, working independently, Leonid Levin, proved that there exist practically relevant problems that are NP-complete – a landmark result in computational complexity theory.\\nModern theoretical computer science research is based on these basic developments, but includes many other mathematical and interdisciplinary problems that have been posed, as shown below:\\n\\n\\n== Topics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Algorithms ===\\n\\nAn algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for calculations. Algorithms are used for calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning.\\nAn algorithm is an effective method expressed as a finite list of well-defined instructions for calculating a function.  Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing \"output\" and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.\\n\\n\\n=== Automata theory ===\\n\\nAutomata theory is the study of abstract machines and automata, as well as the computational problems that can be solved using them. It is a theory in theoretical computer science, under discrete mathematics (a section of mathematics and also of computer science). Automata comes from the Greek word αὐτόματα meaning \"self-acting\".\\nAutomata Theory is the study of self-operating virtual machines to help in the logical understanding of input and output process, without or with intermediate stage(s) of computation (or any function/process).\\n\\n\\n=== Coding theory ===\\n\\nCoding theory is the study of the properties of codes and their fitness for a specific application. Codes are used for data compression, cryptography, error correction and more recently also for network coding. Codes are studied by various scientific disciplines – such as information theory, electrical engineering,  mathematics, and computer science – for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable data transmission methods. This typically involves the removal of redundancy and the correction (or detection) of errors in the transmitted data.\\n\\n\\n=== Computational complexity theory ===\\n\\nComputational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other. A computational problem is understood to be a \\n\\nAutomata theory is the study of abstract machines and automata, as well as the computational problems that can be solved using them. It is a theory in theoretical computer science with close connections to mathematical logic. The word automata comes from the Greek word αὐτόματος, which means \"self-acting, self-willed, self-moving\". An automaton (automata in plural) is an abstract self-propelled computing device which follows a predetermined sequence of operations automatically. An automaton with a finite number of states is called a finite automaton (FA) or finite-state machine (FSM). The figure on the right illustrates a finite-state machine, which is a well-known type of automaton.  This automaton consists of states (represented in the figure by circles) and transitions (represented by arrows).  As the automaton sees a symbol of input, it makes a transition (or jump) to another state, according to its transition function, which takes the previous state and current input symbol as its arguments.\\nAutomata theory is closely related to formal language theory. In this context, automata are used as finite representations of formal languages that may be infinite. Automata are often classified by the class of formal languages they can recognize, as in the Chomsky hierarchy, which describes a nesting relationship between major classes of automata. Automata play a major role in the theory of computation, compiler construction, artificial intelligence, parsing and formal verification.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe theory of abstract automata was developed in the mid-20th century in connection with finite automata. Automata theory was initially considered a branch of mathematical systems theory, studying the behavior of discrete-parameter systems. Early work in automata theory differed from previous work on systems by using abstract algebra to describe information systems rather than differential calculus to describe material systems. The theory of the finite-state transducer was developed under different names by different research communities. The earlier concept of Turing machine was also included in the discipline along with new forms of infinite-state automata, such as pushdown automata.\\n1956 saw the publication of Automata Studies, which collected work by scientists including Claude Shannon, W. Ross Ashby, John von Neumann, Marvin Minsky, Edward F. Moore, and Stephen Cole Kleene. With the publication of this volume, \"automata theory emerged as a relatively autonomous discipline\". The book included Kleene\\'s description of the set of regular events, or regular languages, and a relatively stable measure of complexity in Turing machine programs by Shannon. \\nIn the same year, Noam Chomsky described the Chomsky hierarchy, a correspondence between automata and formal grammars, and Ross Ashby published An Introduction to Cybernetics, an accessible textbook explaining automata and information using basic set theory.\\nThe study of linear bounded automata led to the Myhill–Nerode theorem, which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a formal language to be regular, and an exact count of the number of states in a minimal machine for the language. The pumping lemma for regular languages, also useful in regularity proofs, was proven in this period by Michael O. Rabin and Dana Scott, along with the computational equivalence of deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata. \\nIn the 1960s, a body of algebraic results known as \"structure theory\" or \"algebraic decomposition theory\" emerged, which dealt with the realization of sequential machines from smaller machines by interconnection. While any finite automaton can be simulated using a  universal gate set, this requires that the simulating circuit contain loops of arbitrary complexity. Structure theory deals with the \"loop-free\" realizability of machines.\\nThe theory of computational complexity also took shape in the 1960s. By the end of the decade, automata theory came to be seen as \"the pure ma\\n\\nIntroduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation is an influential computer science textbook by John Hopcroft and Jeffrey Ullman on formal languages and the theory of computation.

Since the second edition, Rajeev Motwani has joined Hopcroft and Ullman as the third author.  Starting with the second edition, the book features extended coverage of examples where automata theory is applied, whereas large parts of more advanced theory were taken out. While this makes the second and third editions more accessible to beginners, it makes it less suited for more advanced courses. The new bias away from theory is not seen positively by all: As Shallit quotes one professor, \"they have removed all good parts.\" (Shallit 2008).\\nThe first edition in turn constituted a major revision of a previous textbook also written by Hopcroft and Ullman, entitled Formal Languages and Their Relation to Automata. It was published in 1968 and is referred to in the introduction of the 1979 edition. \\nIn a personal historical note regarding the 1968 book, Hopcroft states: \"Perhaps the success of the book came from our efforts to present the essence of each proof before actually giving the proof\" (Hopcroft 1989). Compared with the forerunner book, the 1979 edition was expanded, and the material was reworked to make it more accessible to students, cf. (Hopcroft 1989).\\nThis gearing towards understandability at the price of succinctness was not seen positively by all. As Hopcroft reports on feedback to the overhauled 1979 edition: \"It seems that our attempts to lower the level of our presentation for the benefit of students by including more detail and explanations had an adverse effect on the faculty, who then had to sift through the added material to outline and prepare their lectures\" (Hopcroft 1989).\\nStill, the most cited edition of the book is apparently the 1979 edition: According to the website CiteSeerX, \\nover 3000 scientific papers freely available online cite this edition of the book.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nIntroduction to the Theory of Computation by Michael Sipser, another standard textbook in the field\\nSolutions to Selected Exercises, Stanford University\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nEntry \"Cinderella book\". In: The Jargon file (version 4.4.7, December 29, 2003).\\nH\\n\\nIn computability theory, a system of data-manipulation rules (such as a model of computation, a computer\\'s instruction set, a programming language, or a cellular automaton) is said to be Turing-complete or computationally universal if it can be used to simulate any Turing machine (devised by English mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing). This means that this system is able to recognize or decode other data-manipulation rule sets. Turing completeness is used as a way to express the power of such a data-manipulation rule set. Virtually all programming languages today are Turing-complete.\\nA related concept is that of Turing equivalence –  two computers P and Q are called equivalent if P can simulate Q and Q can simulate P. The Church–Turing thesis conjectures that any function whose values can be computed by an algorithm can be computed by a Turing machine, and therefore that if any real-world computer can simulate a Turing machine, it is Turing equivalent to a Turing machine. A universal Turing machine can be used to simulate any Turing machine and by extension the purely computational aspects of any possible real-world computer.\\nTo show that something is Turing-complete, it is enough to demonstrate that it can be used to simulate some Turing-complete system. No physical system can have infinite memory, but if the limitation of finite memory is ignored, most programming languages are otherwise Turing-complete.\\n\\n\\n== Non-mathematical usage ==\\nIn colloquial usage, the terms \"Turing-complete\" and \"Turing-equivalent\" are used to mean that any real-world general-purpose computer or computer language can approximately simulate the computational aspects of any other real-world general-purpose computer or computer language. In real life, this leads to the practical concepts of computing virtualization and emulation.\\nReal computers constructed so far can be functionally analyzed like a single-tape Turing machine (which uses a \"tape\" for memory); thus the associated mathematics can apply by abstracting their operation far enough. However, real computers have limited physical resources, so they are only linear bounded automaton complete.  In contrast, the abstraction of a universal computer is defined as a device with a Turing-complete instruction set, infinite memory, and infinite available time.\\n\\n\\n== Formal definitions ==\\nIn computability theory, several closely related terms are used to describe the computational power of a computational system (such as an abstract machine or programming language):\\n\\nTuring completeness\\nA computational system that can compute every Turing-computable function is called Turing-complete (or Turing-powerful). Alternatively, such a system is one that can simulate a universal Turing machine.\\nTuring equivalence\\nA Turing-complete system is called Turing-equivalent if every function it can compute is also Turing-computable; i.e., it computes precisely the same class of functions as do Turing machines. Alternatively, a Turing-equivalent system is one that can simulate, and be simulated by, a universal Turing machine. (All known physically-implementable Turing-complete systems are Turing-equivalent, which adds support to the Church–Turing thesis.)\\n(Computational) universality\\nA system is called universal with respect to a class of systems if it can compute every function computable by systems in that class (or can simulate each of those systems). Typically, the term \\'universality\\' is tacitly used with respect to a Turing-complete class of systems. The term \"weakly universal\" is sometimes used to distinguish a system (e.g. a cellular automaton) whose universality is achieved only by modifying the standard definition of Turing machine so as to include input streams with infinitely many 1s.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nTuring completeness is significant in that every real-world design for a computing device can be simulated by a universal Turing machine. The Church–Turing thesis states that this is a law of mathematics \\n\\nIn computer science, the computational complexity or simply complexity of an algorithm is the amount of resources required to run it. Particular focus is given to computation time (generally measured by the number of needed elementary operations) and memory storage requirements. The complexity of a problem is the complexity of the best algorithms that allow solving the problem.\\nThe study of the complexity of explicitly given algorithms is called analysis of algorithms, while the study of the complexity of problems is called computational complexity theory. Both areas are highly related, as the complexity of an algorithm is always an upper bound on the complexity of the problem solved by this algorithm. Moreover, for designing efficient algorithms, it is often fundamental to compare the complexity of a specific algorithm to the complexity of the problem to be solved. Also, in most cases, the only thing that is known about the complexity of a problem is that it is lower than the complexity of the most efficient known algorithms. Therefore, there is a large overlap between analysis of algorithms and complexity theory.\\nAs the amount of resources required to run an algorithm generally varies with the size of the input, the complexity is typically expressed as a function n → f(n), where n is the size of the input and f(n) is either the worst-case complexity (the maximum of the amount of resources that are needed over all inputs of size n) or the average-case complexity (the average of the amount of resources over all inputs of size n). Time complexity is generally expressed as the number of required elementary operations on an input of size n, where elementary operations are assumed to take a constant amount of time on a given computer and change only by a constant factor when run on a different computer. Space complexity is generally expressed as the amount of memory required by an algorithm on an input of size n.\\n\\n\\n== Resources ==',\n",
       " '== Resources ==\\n\\n\\n=== Time ===\\nThe resource that is most commonly considered is time. When \"complexity\" is used without qualification, this generally means time complexity.\\nThe usual units of time (seconds, minutes etc.) are not used in complexity theory because they are too dependent on the choice of a specific computer and on the evolution of technology. For instance, a computer today can execute an algorithm significantly faster than a computer from the 1960s; however, this is not an intrinsic feature of the algorithm but rather a consequence of technological advances in computer hardware. Complexity theory seeks to quantify the intrinsic time requirements of algorithms, that is, the basic time constraints an algorithm would place on any computer. This is achieved by counting the number of elementary operations that are executed during the computation. These operations are assumed to take constant time (that is, not affected by the size of the input) on a given machine, and are often called steps.\\n\\n\\n=== Bit complexity ===\\n\\nFormally, the bit complexity refers to the number of operations on bits that are needed for running an algorithm. With most models of computation, it equals the time complexity up to a constant factor. On computers, the number of operations on machine words that are needed is also proportional to the bit complexity. So, the time complexity and the bit complexity are equivalent  for realistic models of computation.\\n\\n\\n=== Space ===\\nAnother important resource is the size of computer memory that is needed for running algorithms.\\n\\n\\n=== Communication ===\\n\\nFor the class of distributed algorithms that are commonly executed by multiple, interacting parties, the resource that is of most interest is the communication complexity. It is the necessary amount of communication between the executing parties.\\n\\n\\n=== Others ===\\nThe number of arithmetic operations is another resource that is commonly used. In this case, one talks of arithmetic complexity. If one knows an upper bound on the size of the binary representa\\n\\nComputability theory, also known as recursion theory, is a branch of mathematical logic, computer science, and the theory of computation that originated in the 1930s with the study of computable functions and Turing degrees. The field has since expanded to include the study of generalized computability and definability. In these areas, computability theory overlaps with proof theory and effective descriptive set theory.\\nBasic questions addressed by computability theory include:\\n\\nWhat does it mean for a function on the natural numbers to be computable?\\nHow can noncomputable functions be classified into a hierarchy based on their level of noncomputability?\\nAlthough there is considerable overlap in terms of knowledge and methods, mathematical computability theorists study the theory of relative computability, reducibility notions, and degree structures; those in the computer science field focus on the theory of subrecursive hierarchies, formal methods, and formal languages. The study of which mathematical constructions can be effectively performed is sometimes called recursive mathematics.\\n\\n\\n== Introduction ==\\n\\nComputability theory originated in the 1930s, with the work of Kurt Gödel, Alonzo Church, Rózsa Péter, Alan Turing, Stephen Kleene, and Emil Post.\\nThe fundamental results the researchers obtained established Turing computability as the correct formalization of the informal idea of effective calculation. In 1952, these results led Kleene to coin the two names \"Church\\'s thesis\":\\u200a300\\u200a and \"Turing\\'s thesis\".:\\u200a376\\u200a Nowadays these are often considered as a single hypothesis, the Church–Turing thesis, which states that any function that is computable by an algorithm is a computable function. Although initially skeptical, by 1946 Gödel argued in favor of this thesis::\\u200a84\\u200a\\n\\n\"Tarski has stressed in his lecture (and I think justly) the great importance of the concept of general recursiveness (or Turing\\'s computability). It seems to me that this importance is largely due to the fact that with this concept one has for the first time succeeded in giving an absolute notion to an interesting epistemological notion, i.e., one not depending on the formalism chosen.\":\\u200a84\\u200a\\nWith a definition of effective calculation came the first proofs that there are problems in mathematics that cannot be effectively decided. In 1936, Church and Turing were inspired by techniques used by Gödel to prove his incompleteness theorems - in 1931, Gödel independently demonstrated that the Entscheidungsproblem is not effectively decidable. This result showed that there is no algorithmic procedure that can correctly decide whether arbitrary mathematical propositions are true or false.\\nMany problems in mathematics have been shown to be undecidable after these initial examples were established. In 1947, Markov and Post published independent papers showing that the word problem for semigroups cannot be effectively decided. Extending this result, Pyotr Novikov and William Boone showed independently in the 1950s that the word problem for groups is not effectively solvable: there is no effective procedure that, given a word in a finitely presented group, will decide whether the element represented by the word is the identity element of the group. In 1970, Yuri Matiyasevich proved (using results of Julia Robinson) Matiyasevich\\'s theorem, which implies that Hilbert\\'s tenth problem has no effective solution; this problem asked whether there is an effective procedure to decide whether a Diophantine equation over the integers has a solution in the integers.\\n\\n\\n== Turing computability ==\\nThe main form of computability studied in the field was introduced by Turing in 1936. A set of natural numbers is said to be a computable set (also called a decidable, recursive, or Turing computable set) if there is a Turing machine that, given a number n, halts with output 1 if n is in the set and halts with output 0 if n is not in the set. A function f from natural numbers to natural numbers i\\n\\nIn mathematics and computer science, computational number theory, also known as algorithmic number theory, is the study of \\ncomputational methods for investigating and solving problems in number theory and arithmetic geometry, including algorithms for primality testing and integer factorization, finding solutions to diophantine equations, and explicit methods in arithmetic geometry.\\nComputational number theory has applications to cryptography, including RSA, elliptic curve cryptography and post-quantum cryptography, and is used to investigate conjectures and open problems in number theory, including the Riemann hypothesis, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, the ABC conjecture, the modularity conjecture, the Sato-Tate conjecture, and explicit aspects of the Langlands program.\\n\\n\\n== Software packages ==\\nMagma computer algebra system\\nSageMath\\nNumber Theory Library\\nPARI/GP\\nFast Library for Number Theory\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nEric Bach; Jeffrey Shallit (1996).

In particular, there are several physical and practical limits to the amount of computation or data storage that can be performed with a given amount of mass, volume, or energy.\\n\\n\\n== Hardware limits or physical limits ==\\n\\n\\n=== Processing and memory density ===\\nThe Bekenstein bound limits the amount of information that can be stored within a spherical volume to the entropy of a black hole with the same surface area.\\nThermodynamics limit the data storage of a system based on its energy, number of particles and particle modes. In practice, it is a stronger bound than the Bekenstein bound.\\n\\n\\n=== Processing speed ===\\nBremermann\\'s limit is the maximum computational speed of a self-contained system in the material universe, and is based on mass–energy versus quantum uncertainty constraints.\\n\\n\\n=== Communication delays ===\\nThe Margolus–Levitin theorem sets a bound on the maximum computational speed per unit of energy: 6 × 1033 operations per second per joule. This bound, however, can be avoided if there is access to quantum memory. Computational algorithms can then be designed that require arbitrarily small amounts of energy/time per one elementary computation step.\\n\\n\\n=== Energy supply ===\\nLandauer\\'s principle defines a lower theoretical limit for energy consumption: kT ln 2 consumed per irreversible state change, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the operating temperature of the computer.  Reversible computing is not subject to this lower bound.  T cannot, even in theory, be made lower than 3 kelvins, the approximate temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, without spending more energy on cooling than is saved in computation. However, on a timescale of 109 – 1010 years, the cosmic microwave background radiation will be decreasing exponentially, which has been argued to eventually enable 1030 as much computations per unit of energy.  Important parts of this argument have been disputed.\\n\\n\\n== Building devices that approach physical limits ==\\nSeveral methods have been proposed for producing computing devices or data storage devices that approach physical and practical limits:\\n\\nA cold degenerate star could conceivably be used as a giant data storage device, by carefully perturbing it to various excited states, in the same manner as an atom or quantum well used for these purposes. Such a star would have to be artificially constructed, as no natural degenerate stars will cool to this temperature for an extremely long time. It is also possible that nucleons on the surface of neutron stars could form complex \"molecules\", which some have suggested might be used for computing purposes, creating a type of computronium based on femtotechnology, which would be faster and denser than computronium based on nanotechnology.\\nIt may be possible to use a black hole as a data storage or computing device, if a practical mechanism for extraction of contained information can be found. Such extraction may in principle be possible (Stephen Hawking\\'s proposed resolution to the black hole information paradox). This would achieve storage density exactly equal to the Bekenstein bound. Seth Lloyd calculated the computational abilities of an \"ultimate laptop\" formed by compressing a kilogram of matter into a black hole of radius 1.485 × 10−27 meters, concluding that it would only last about 10−19 seconds before evaporating due to Hawking radiation, but that during this brief time it could compute at a rate of about 5 × 1050 operations per second, ultimately performing about 1032 operations on 1016 bits (~1 PB). Lloyd notes that \"Interestingly, although this hypothetical computation is performed at ultra-high densities and speeds, the total number of bits available to be processed is not far from the number available to current computers operating in more familiar surroundings.\"\\nIn The Singularity Is Near, Ray Kurzweil cites the calculations of Seth Lloyd that a universa\\n\\nAlgorithmic game theory (AGT) is an area in the intersection of game theory and computer science, with the objective of understanding and design of algorithms in strategic environments.\\nTypically, in Algorithmic Game Theory problems, the input to a given algorithm is distributed among many players who have a personal interest in the output. In those situations, the agents might not report the input truthfully because of their own personal interests. We can see Algorithmic Game Theory from two perspectives:\\n\\nAnalysis: given the currently implemented algorithms, analyze them using Game Theory tools (e.g., calculate and prove properties on their Nash equilibria, price of anarchy, and best-response dynamics).\\nDesign: design games that have both good game-theoretical and algorithmic properties. This area is called algorithmic mechanism design.\\nOn top of the usual requirements in classical algorithm design (e.g., polynomial-time running time, good approximation ratio), the designer must also care about incentive constraints.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Nisan-Ronen: a new framework for studying algorithms ===\\nIn 1999, the seminal paper of Noam Nisan and Amir Ronen drew the attention of the Theoretical Computer Science community to designing algorithms for selfish (strategic) users. As they claim in the abstract:\\n\\nWe consider algorithmic problems in a distributed setting where the participants cannot be assumed to follow the algorithm but rather their own self-interest. As such participants, termed agents, are capable of manipulating the algorithm, the algorithm designer should ensure in advance that the agents’ interests are best served by behaving correctly.\\nFollowing notions from the field of mechanism design, we suggest a framework for studying such algorithms. In this model the algorithmic solution is adorned with payments to the participants and is termed a mechanism. The payments should be carefully chosen as to motivate all participants to act as the algorithm designer wishes. We apply the standard tools of mechanism design to algorithmic problems and in particular to the shortest path problem.\\nThis paper coined the term algorithmic mechanism design and was recognized by the 2012 Gödel Prize committee as one of \"three papers laying foundation of growth in Algorithmic Game Theory\".\\n\\n\\n=== Price of Anarchy ===\\n\\nThe other two papers cited in the 2012 Gödel Prize for fundamental contributions to Algorithmic Game Theory introduced and developed the concept of \"Price of Anarchy\". \\nIn their 1999 paper \"Worst-case Equilibria\", Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou proposed a new measure of the degradation of system efficiency due to the selfish behavior of its agents: the ratio of between system efficiency at an optimal configuration, and its efficiency at the worst Nash equilibrium. (The term \"Price of Anarchy\" only appeared a couple of years later.)\\n\\n\\n=== The Internet as a catalyst ===\\nThe Internet created a new economy—both as a foundation for exchange and commerce, and in its own right. The computational nature of the Internet allowed for the use of computational tools in this new emerging economy. On the other hand, the Internet itself is the outcome of actions of many. This was new to the classic, ‘top-down’ approach to computation that held till then. Thus, game theory is a natural way to view the Internet and interactions within it, both human and mechanical.\\nGame theory studies equilibria (such as the Nash equilibrium). An equilibrium is generally defined as a state in which no player has an incentive to change their strategy. Equilibria are found in several fields related to the Internet, for instance financial interactions and communication load-balancing. Game theory provides tools to analyze equilibria, and a common approach is then to ‘find the game’—that is, to formalize specific Internet interactions as a game, and to derive the associated equilibria.\\nRephrasing problems in terms of games allows the analysis of Internet-based interac',\n",

In London, David attended Geneva House school in Cricklewood (his parents owned and ran the Alma restaurant on Cricklewood Broadway), followed by William Ellis School in Highgate before reading Natural Sciences at Clare College, Cambridge and taking Part III of the Mathematical Tripos. He went on to Wolfson College, Oxford for his doctorate in theoretical physics, about quantum field theory in curved space-time, supervised by Dennis Sciama and Philip Candelas.\",\n",
       " '== Career and research ==\\nHis work on quantum algorithms began with a 1985 paper, later expanded in 1992 along with Richard Jozsa, to produce the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm, one of the first examples of a quantum algorithm that is exponentially faster than any possible deterministic classical algorithm. In his nomination for election as a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2008, his contributions were described as:\\n\\n[having] laid the foundations of the quantum theory of computation, and has subsequently made or participated in many of the most important advances in the field, including the discovery of the first quantum algorithms, the theory of quantum logic gates and quantum computational networks, the first quantum error-correction scheme, and several fundamental quantum universality results. He has set the agenda for worldwide research efforts in this new, interdisciplinary field, made progress in understanding its philosophical implications (via a variant of the many-universes interpretation) and made it comprehensible to the general public, notably in his book The Fabric of Reality.\\nSince 2012, he has been working on constructor theory, an attempt at generalizing the quantum theory of computation to cover not just computation but all physical processes. Together with Chiara Marletto, he published a paper in December 2014 entitled Constructor theory of information, that conjectures that information can be expressed solely in terms of which transformations of physical systems are possible and which are impossible.\\n\\n\\n=== The Fabric of Reality ===\\n\\nIn his 1997 book The Fabric of Reality, Deutsch details his \"Theory of Everything\".

His theory of everything is somewhat emergentist rather than reductive.

It is a key topic of the field of computability theory within mathematical logic and the theory of computation within computer science. The computability of a problem is closely linked to the existence of an algorithm to solve the problem.\\nThe most widely studied models of computability are the Turing-computable and μ-recursive functions, and the lambda calculus, all of which have computationally equivalent power. Other forms of computability are studied as well: computability notions weaker than Turing machines are studied in automata theory, while computability notions stronger than Turing machines are studied in the field of hypercomputation.\\n\\n\\n== Problems ==\\nA central idea in computability is that of a (computational) problem, which is a task whose computability can be explored.\\nThere are two key types of problems:\\n\\nA decision problem fixes a set S, which may be a set of strings, natural numbers, or other objects taken from some larger set U. A particular instance of the problem is to decide, given an element u of U, whether u is in S. For example, let U be the set of natural numbers and S the set of prime numbers. The corresponding decision problem corresponds to primality testing.\\nA function problem consists of a function f from a set U to a set V. An instance of the problem is to compute, given an element u in U, the corresponding element f(u) in V.  For example, U and V may be the set of all finite binary strings, and f may take a string and return the string obtained by reversing the digits of the input (so f(0101) = 1010).\\nOther types of problems include search problems and optimization problems.\\nOne goal of computability theory is to determine which problems, or classes of problems, can be solved in each model of computation.\\n\\n\\n== Formal models of computation ==\\n\\nA model of computation is a formal description of a particular type of computational process. The description often takes the form of an abstract machine that is meant to perform the task at hand. General models of computation equivalent to a Turing machine (see Church–Turing thesis) include:\\n\\nLambda calculus\\nA computation consists of an initial lambda expression (or two if you want to separate the function and its input) plus a finite sequence of lambda terms, each deduced from the preceding term by one application of beta reduction.\\nCombinatory logic\\nA concept which has many similarities to \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        λ\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\lambda }\\n  \\n-calculus, but also important differences exist (e.g. fixed point combinator Y has normal form in combinatory logic but not in \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        λ\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\lambda }\\n  \\n-calculus). Combinatory logic was developed with great ambitions: understanding the nature of paradoxes, making foundations of mathematics more economic (conceptually), eliminating the notion of variables (thus clarifying their role in mathematics).\\nμ-recursive functions\\nA computation consists of a μ-recursive function, i.e. its defining sequence, any input value(s) and a sequence of recursive functions appearing in the defining sequence with inputs and outputs. Thus, if in the defining sequence of a recursive function f(x) the functions g(x) and h(x,y) appear, then terms of the form g(5) = 7 or h(3,2) = 10 might appear.  Each entry in this sequence needs to be an application of a basic function or follow from the entries above by using composition, primitive recursion or μ-recursion.  For instance if f(x) = h(x,g(x)), then for f(5) = 3 to appear, terms like g(5) = 6 and h(5,6) = 3 must occur above. The computation terminates only if the final term gives the value of the recursive function applied to the inputs.\\nString rewriting systems\\nIncludes Markov algorithms, that use grammar-like rules to operate on strings of symbols; also Post canonical system.\\nRegister machine\\nA theoretical idealization of a computer.

This field is mainly focused on mathematical structures called automata and is crucial for the purpose of studying processes occurring in discrete systems.\\nWhat is Automata Theory?\\nIn automata theory, scientists and engineers can predict the behavior of computing systems thereby improving problem-solving approaches. Originally developed to describe and explain the dynamics of systems, automata theory is the theoretical base of the formal languages theory, grammar, and computational complexity.\\nBasic Terminologies of Theory of Computation\\nNow, let’s understand the basic terminologies, which are important and frequently used in the Theory of Computation.\\xa0\\nSymbol\\nA symbol (often also called a character) is the smallest building block, which can be any alphabet, letter, or picture.\\xa0\\n\\nAlphabets (Σ)\\nAlphabets are a set of symbols, which are always finite.\\xa0\\n\\nString\\xa0\\nA string is a finite sequence of symbols from some alphabet. A string is generally denoted as w and the length of a string is denoted as |w|.\\xa0\\nEmpty string is the string with zero occurrence of symbols, represented as ε.\\nNumber of Strings (of length 2) that can be generated over the alphabet {a, b}:                     -   -                     a   a                     a   b                     b   a                     b   bLength of String |w| = 2Number of Strings = 4Conclusion:For alphabet {a, b} with length n, number of strings can be generated = 2n.\\n__mask-blockquote__index=1__\\n\\nThe Theory of Computation explores automata, languages, and complexity. If you want to dive deeper into this subject for GATE, the GATE CS Self-Paced Course covers it extensively.\\n\\nClosure Representation in TOC\\nL+: It is a Positive Closure that represents a set of all strings except Null or ε-strings.\\nL*: It is “Kleene Closure“, that represents the occurrence of certain alphabets for given language alphabets from zero to the infinite number of times. In which ε-string is also included.\\nFrom the above two statements, it can be concluded that:\\nL* = εL+\\nExample:(a) Regular expression for language accepting all combination of g\\'s over Σ={g}:                                         R = g*                               R={ε,g,gg,ggg,gggg,ggggg,...}(b) Regular Expression for language accepting all combination of g\\'s over Σ={g} : R = g+                               R={g,gg,ggg,gggg,ggggg,gggggg,...}\\nNote: Σ* is a set of all possible strings(often power set(need not be unique here or we can say multiset) of string) So this implies that language is a subset of Σ*.This is also called a “Kleene Star”.\\nKleene Star is also called a “Kleene Operator” or “Kleene Closure”. Engineers and IT professionals make use of Kleene Star to achieve all set of strings which is to be included from a given set of characters or symbols. It is one kind of Unary operator. In Kleene Star methodology all individual elements of a given string must be present but additional elements or combinations of these alphabets can be included to any extent.\\nExample:Input String: \"GFG\".Σ* = { ε,\"GFG\",\"GGFG\",\"GGFG\",\"GFGGGGGGGG\",\"GGGGGGGGFFFFFFFFFGGGGGGGG\",...}  (Kleene Star is an infinite set but if we provide any grammar rules then it can work as a finite set.Please note that we can include ε string also in given Kleene star representation.)\\nLanguage\\nA language is a set of strings, chosen from some Σ* or we can say- ‘A language is a subset of Σ* ‘. A language that can be formed over ‘ Σ ‘ can be Finite or Infinite.\\nExample of Finite Language:           L1 = { set of string of 2 }         L1 = { xy, yx, xx, yy }Example of Infinite Language:         L1 = { set of all strings starts with \\'b\\' }         L1 = { babb, baa, ba, bbb, baab, ....... }\\nConclusion\\nIt is an important branch of computation that is concerned with formal languages, and automata theory in particular. It provides a basis for other courses such as Turing machines and computational complexity that are very important in computer science.\\nIntroduction of Theory of Computation – FAQs\\nWhat is the relevance of the automata theory in computer science?\\n\\nAutomata theory is used in modeling computational problems hence enhancing the understanding and design of systems such as compilers, interpreters among others.\\n\\nwhat is the purpose of using Kleene Star in the study of formal languages?\\n\\nThe Kleene Star extends symbols from a given alphabet where one is able to create infinite strings from it or even the null string.\\n\\nIs it possible to implement automata theory into real life?\\n\\nOf course, automata theory has found its use in certain areas like compiler design, artificial intelligence, network security and natural language processing.\\n\\n \\n\\nabhishek1 \\n\\n Follow \\n\\n \\n\\nImprove\\n\\n\\nPrevious Article\\n\\nAutomata Tutorial\\n\\n\\nNext Article\\n\\n\\nChomsky Hierarchy in Theory of Computation\\n\\n\\nRead More\\n\\nSimilar Reads\\n\\nIntroduction to Computation Complex Theory\\nBroad Overview : Complexity theory, in a nutshell, a complexity word is a quite fancy word, literally, it sounds complex, but it is not an intimidating topic.
