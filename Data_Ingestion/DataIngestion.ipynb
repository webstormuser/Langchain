He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister outside the Indian National Congress.\\nModi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight. At the age of 18, he was married to Jashodaben Modi, whom he abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging her four decades later when legally required to do so. Modi became a full-time worker for the RSS in Gujarat in 1971. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he rose through the party hierarchy, becoming general secretary in 1998. In 2001, Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat and elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration is considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots, and has been criticised for its management of the crisis. According to official records, a little over 1,000 people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim; independent sources estimated 2,000 deaths, mostly Muslim.

His administration increased direct foreign investment, and reduced spending on healthcare, education, and social-welfare programmes. Modi began a high-profile sanitation campaign, controversially initiated a demonetisation of banknotes and introduced the Goods and Services Tax, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws.

In grief, Modi submits his resignation which is eventually declined as he had done a lot of work for the party. He was transferred to New Delhi for groundwork.

Modi liberalized India\\'s foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including in defense and the railways.\\n\\n\\n=== Labour reform ===\\nOther reforms included removing many of the country\\'s labor laws. Some scholars alleged said labour reforms were made to make it harder for workers to form unions and easier for employers to hire and fire them.\\nThese reforms met with support from institutions such as the World Bank, but opposition from some scholars within the country. The labor laws also drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country\\'s largest unions went on strike, including one affiliated with the BJP. The strike was estimated to have cost the economy $3.7 billion.\\nThe Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a constituent of the Sangh Parivar, stated that the reforms would hurt laborers by making it easier for corporations to exploit them.\\n\\n\\n=== Economy ===\\nIn his first budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley promised to gradually reduce the budgetary deficit from 4.1% to 3% over two years and to divest from shares in public banks.\\nOver Modi\\'s first year in office, the Indian GDP grew at a rate of 7.5%, making India the fastest-growing economy in the world. For this the basis was a revised formula introduced a year after he took office, which surprised a lot of economists.\\nHowever, this rate of growth had fallen significantly to 6.1%, by his third year in office. This fall has been blamed on the exercise of demonetisation of currency.\\nIn July 2014, Modi refused to sign a trade agreement that would permit the World Trade Organization to implement a deal agreed in Bali, citing that agreement will lead to \"lack of protection to Indian farmers and the needs of food security\" and \"Lack of bargaining power\".

Her mother died when she was two years old.\\nNarendra Modi and Jashodaben had an arranged marriage, starting with a family-arranged betrothal in their very early childhood. According to Narendra Modi\\'s brother, the couple had undergone vivaaha, the religious ceremony of Marriage when Narendra Modi was 18 and Jashodaben was about 17.\\nA marriage ceremony was held to begin their married life together when she was 17 and he was 18. Modi left home soon after the marriage.\\nAfter about two years of being out of contact with all who knew him, Modi returned to Vadnagar and contacted his family. He had made plans to go to Ahmedabad to work at his uncle\\'s canteen. At his mother\\'s insistence, Jashodaben came to the family household to maintain their marriage, but her husband objected to the arrangement, insisting on continuing his life on his own terms and encouraging her to continue in her studies.\\n\\nHe told me once that \"I will be travelling across the country and will go as and where I please; what will you do following me?\" When I came to Vadnagar to live with his family, he told me \"Why did you come to your in-laws\\' house when you are still so young, you must instead focus on pursuing your studies.\" The decision to leave was my own and there was never any conflict between us. He never spoke to me about the RSS or about his political leanings. When he told me he would be moving around the country as he wished, I told him I would like to join him. However, on many occasions when I went to my in-laws\\' place, he would not be present and he stopped coming there. He used to spend a lot of time in RSS shakhas. So I too stopped going there after a point and I went back to my father\\'s house.\\nJashodaben said that she spent a total of about three months with her husband during a three-year period before their final separation.\\nJashodaben continued with her professional life, receiving a Secondary School Certificate in 1972 or 1974, completing teacher\\'s training in 1976 and becoming a teacher in 1978. From 1978 to 1990, she taught in Banaskantha district.\\nIn 1991, she moved to Rajosana village, where she now remains. She is retired and her pension is ₹14,000 (US$170) per month. One commentator said that her low salary would have made much of life a hardship for her. Talking about her relationship with Modi, in one interview Jashodaben said \"We have never been in touch... There has been no communication from his end to this day.\" In a later interview Jashodaben said that until 1987, she and Modi spoke \"normally\".

In 1992, Jashodaben refused to be interviewed by the newspaper Abhiyan when that publication presented a story on the marriage of her and Modi. Darshan Desai, a reporter for The Indian Express, located Jashodaben in May 2002, but she and others in her village had refused to speak to him and he was told to leave the town.

Following this, Mukherjee invited Modi and under the powers vested on him under Constitution of India, appointed him as the Prime Minister of India and sought his advice for the names of the members of the council of ministers of his government.

Both officers were part of Modi\\'s government in Gujarat during his tenure as Chief Minister.\\nOn 31 May 2014, Prime Minister Modi abolished all existing Group of Ministers (GoMs) and Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoMs).

The Ministries and Departments will now process the issues pending before the EGoMs and GoMs and take appropriate decisions at the level of Ministries and Departments itself\". The UPA-II government had set up 68 GoMs and 14 EGoMs during its tenure, of which 9 EGoMs and 21 GoMs were inherited by the new government. The move was described by the Indian media as being in alignment with Modi\\'s policy of \"minimum government, maximum governance\". The Indian Express stated that the GoMs and EGoMs had become \"a symbol and an instrument of policy paralysis during the previous UPA government\". The Times of India described the new government\\'s decision as \"a move to restore the authority of the Union Cabinet in decision-making and ensure ministerial accountability\".\\nNewly appointed cabinet minister Gopinath Munde, who was in charge of the Rural Development, Panchayati Raj, and Drinking Water and Sanitation portfolios, died in a car crash in Delhi on 3 June 2014.

He also decided to reconstitute five crucial Cabinet Committees. These included the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) that handles all high-level defence and security matters, the Appointments Committee of Cabinet (ACC) that recommends to the President all senior bureaucratic appointments and postings, the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs (CCPA) which is a sort of small cabinet and the Cabinet Comm'),\n",

In 2001, Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat and elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration is considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots, and has been criticised for its management of the crisis. According to official records, a little over 1,000 people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim; independent sources estimated 2,000 deaths, mostly Muslim. A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India in 2012 found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against him. While his policies as chief minister were credited for encouraging economic growth, his administration was criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.\\nIn the 2014 Indian general election, Modi led the BJP to a parliamentary majority, the first for a party since 1984. His administration increased direct foreign investment, and reduced spending on healthcare, education, and social-welfare programmes. Modi began a high-profile sanitation campaign, controversially initiated a demonetisation of banknotes and introduced the Goods and Services Tax, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. Modi's administration launched the 2019 Balakot airstrike against an alleged terrorist training camp in Pakistan. The airstrike failed, but the action had nationalist appeal. Modi's party won the 2019 general election which followed. In its second term, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, and introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act, prompting widespread protests, and spurring the 2020 Delhi riots in which Muslims were brutalised and killed by Hindu mobs. Three controversial farm laws led to sit-ins by farmers across the country, eventually causing their formal repeal. Modi oversaw India's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which, according to the World Health Organization's estimates, 4.7 million Indians died. In the 2024 general election, Modi's party lost its majority in the lower house of Parliament and formed a government leading the National Democratic Alliance coalition.\\nUnder Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding, or the weakening of democratic institutions, individual rights, and freedom of expression. As prime minister, he has received consistently high approval ratings. Modi has been described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics. He remains a controversial figure domestically and internationally, over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and handling of the Gujarat riots, which have been cited as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nNarendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati Hindu family of oil presser (Modh-Ghanchi) which is an Other Backward Class (OBC) category in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat).

       "\"The Narendra Modi Stadium is an international cricket stadium located in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. With a seating capacity of 132,000, it is the largest stadium in the world.  The stadium, owned by the Gujarat Cricket Association, hosts both domestic and international cricket matches. It is recognized as one of the world's premier cricket venues. The stadium has hosted several high-profile matches such as the 2023 World Cup final. It is named after Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\\nThe land which holds Narendra Modi Stadium was formerly occupied by another venue, Sardar Patel Stadium. It served as the arena for domestic and international cricket in the city until its demolition in 2015, hosting matches during the 1987, 1996, and 2011 ICC World Cups. In 2014, it was decided that a new stadium should be built on the same plot. The new stadium, originally named Motera Stadium, was designed by Australia's design firm Populous and built by Larsen and Toubro. It took 5 years to build, at an estimated cost of ₹800 crore (US$96 million). Once completed, the new arena replaced the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground as the world's largest cricket stadium. The stadium has 4 dressing rooms, 11 center pitches, and 2 practice grounds. The practice grounds can additionally serve as venues for domestic matches.\\nThe new stadium was first opened to the public in 2020 amid the Namaste Trump event. In February 2021, the stadium was renamed Narendra Modi Stadium in honour of Indian prime minister at the time, Narendra Modi. The prime minister had previously served as chief minister of Gujarat (2001–2014) as well as president of the GCA (2009-2014). In 2021, the stadium was inaugurated with Indian president Ram Nath Kovind presiding over the event.\\nOn 24 February 2021, the stadium hosted its first Test match, when home side India played against England. It was also its first day-night test game. On 29 September 2022, the opening ceremony of the 2022 National Games of India was held in the stadium.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== 1982–2006 ===\\nPrior to 1982, international cricket matches in Ahmedabad were played at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium (located in Navrangpura), owned by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation.\\nIn 1982, the Government of Gujarat allocated a 400,000-square-metre (100-acre) stretch of land on the banks of the Sabarmati River to build a new stadium. Construction of the stadium was completed in nine months. The venue was originally known simply as Gujarat Stadium, however, it was soon renamed Sardar Patel Stadium (not to be confused with the previously-mentioned site in Navrangpura), after Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India's first home minister and deputy prime minister. Since its completion, all international cricket fixtures in Ahmedabad have been held at the site. In the 1984-85 Australia India series, Sardar Patel Stadium hosted its first ODI, which India lost.\\nAt the arena, Sunil Gavaskar became the first batter to score 10,000 runs in Test cricket, a feat he accomplished against Pakistan in their 1987 tour. In 1983, Kapil Dev took a nine-wicket haul against the West Indies in 1983, and claimed his 432nd Test wicket at the stadium. This made him the highest wicket-taker in the world in 1995, breaking Sir Richard Hadlee's previous record. In 1996, the ground hosted a low-scoring Test match against South Africa, in which the visitors lost 105–223.\\nSardar Patel Stadium hosted one game each in the 1987 and 1996 World Cups, including the first match of the 1996 World Cup between England and New Zealand.\\n\\n\\n=== 2006–2015 ===\\n\\nIn 2006, The stadium became a focal venue of ICC Champions Trophy and hosted five of the 15 games played. In preparation for the tournament, the stadium was renovated to add three new pitches and a new outfield. Floodlights and covered stands were also introduced at the stadium as a part of the renovation program.\\nIn the 2010 New Zealand tour of India, the first Test of the series was held at the venue, in which Kane Williamson\""
